# Supplementary Material

On this page, I will post additional resources and supplementary material for the course.

## Resources for R

In this course, we will use R as the main computational tool. Below are some resources:

  - [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
  - Jenny Bryan's course on [Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R](https://stat545.com/)
  - Mine Cetinkaya's curated list of [resources for R](https://github.com/rstudio-education/rstats-ed)
  - If you're looking for a deep understanding of R, I recommend Hadley Wickham's book [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)
